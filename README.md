# ELKmanuscript
Code for recreating the results in the manuscript on ELK, "Bayesian Multiresolution Modeling of Georeferenced Data." Used in conjunction with function in the ELK repository, and 2014 Kenya DHS data (not included for privacy reasons) downloaded from dhsprogram.com. Simulated datasets, however, and datasets that are not private are included here.

The ELK and ELKmanuscript repositories are assumed to be subdirectories in the directory ~/git/.
